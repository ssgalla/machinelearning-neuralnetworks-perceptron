10.2 MACHINE LEARNING - NEURAL NETWORKS - PERCEPTRON

To open the perceptron please navigate to the following 

processing-3.4 -> perceptronCT -> CC_simplePerceptron

open the files with i3 processing which is included in the files then click run alternatively click on the application folders and run independent Java application



Scenario

we have a canvas which needs to be arbitrarily divided with points on both side. We are going to use the perceptron for classifying the points on either side.

PERCEPTRON ALGORITHM

1. For every input, multiply that input by its weight
2. Sum all of the weighted inputs
3. Compute the output of the perceptron based on that sum passed function (the sign of sum)

GRADIENT DESCENT 

1. Provide the perceptron with inputs for which there is aknown answer
2. Ask the perceptron to guess and answer
3. Compute the error ( did it get the answer right or wrong?)
4. Adjust all the weights according to the error
5. Return to step 1 and repeat
